# Roadmap (version 0.3.0):
# - Finalize base and standard Welkin
#   - Incorporate these into the standard itself
# - Implement the InformationTree and ExecutableTree classes
#   - Connect the implementation of both into CFLT
#   - Ensure that Label works for ascii, unicode. (Plugins can be made for esoteric languages)
# - Figure out how to best bootstrap new features (e.g., direct interface to the operating system)
